# Shopify-Data-Challenge-Summer-2022

The task was to identify and calculate a metric to report for this dataset.

Two metrics were calculated: 
- total order_amount per shop_id (and total items )
- order_amount per payment_method (and total items)

### Total Order amount per shop_id
A preliminary graph shows that 2 shops have significantly higher order_amount's than the rest. 

After calculating, we can see that **shop_id 42 has the highest total order amount followed by shop_id 78**.

### Order amount per payment_method
Once again, the graph shows us that credit cards have higher order amounts (and total_items) compared to cash and debit. 
This tells us that the **majority of transactions occour using credit cards**
